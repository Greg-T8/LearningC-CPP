## The Basics

A *declaration* is a statement that introduces a name into a program. It specifies a type for the named entity:
- A *type* defines a set of possible values and a set of operations (for an object)
- An *object* is some memory that hodls a value of some type
- A *value* is a set of bits interpreted according to a type
- A *variable* is a named object
